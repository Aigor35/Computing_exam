# Computing_exam

The objective of this project was writing a program able to mimic
the movements of the user's face along the x, y and z axis,
as well as the rotation of the user's face around the axis perpendicular
to the user's monitor.\n
This objective has been achieved through the files "Capture_reference_image.py",
"Virtual_face_motion.py" and "Tests.py".\n
The first file allows the user to obtain the resources necessary to make
the file "Virtual_face_motion.py" work.\n
"Virtual_face_motion.py" is the core of the project since its role
is exactly following the user's movements and mimicking them.\n
More precisely, this file generates a virtual space containing an
object shaped like a human head.\n
As the user moves, the virtual head repeats the movements in real time.
The last file, "Tests.py", contains all the tests to which the
"Virtual_face_motion.py" file has been subjected.\n
The project has been built using the software "PyCharm",
therefore it's recommended to use this software to run the different files.
